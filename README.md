This is my graduation project, developed as part of my final-year thesis.
The project involves designing and implementing a custom embedded system using the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller.
It focuses on initializing and managing various peripherals such as GPIO, UART, and SPI, and demonstrates the core functions of a custom hardware board (Board_V1).
The project was developed using STM32CubeIDE, STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeMonitor.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project is developed to test and validate the custom STM32 hardware board version 1. It includes initialization of basic peripherals such as GPIO, UART, SPI, and timers.
